# 4. Input Validation

As the back-end input validation mechanism, we utilized Laravel's Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator class, which provides the ability to define and apply various validation rules. This was applied to validate inputs in forms such as the login/register form, the edit user profile form, and the event creation form, ensuring that all data adheres to strict rules before processing. 

**Back-End Validation**
* Validation in Event Creation: During event creation, fields like event_date, refund, and capacity are validated for type and range
```
$validator = Validator::make($data, [
    'event_date' => 'required|date|after_or_equal:tomorrow',
    'refund' => 'required|numeric|between:0,100',
    'capacity' => 'required|numeric|min:10',
]);
```

* Password Hash Validation: For secure password verification during login and account deletion, we used Laravel's Hash::check
```
if (!Hash::check($password, $this->password)) {
    return [
        'status' => false,
        'message' => 'The provided password is incorrect.',
    ];
}
```

**Front-End Validation**
For client-side validation, we utilized JavaScript to provide immediate feedback to users

* File Input Validation: When uploading a profile picture or event media, HTML `<input type="file">` ensures that users select a file before submission

```
<input type="file" id="profile_pic" name="profile_pic_url" required />
```

* Validation in Comment: When a user attempts to post a comment but leaves the input empty, a warning is displayed to alert them
```
if (commentText.trim() === '') {
        document.getElementById('error-new-comment').textContent = 'Please write a comment.';
        hasError = true;
    }
```
