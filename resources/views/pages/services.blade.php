            <h2>Event Management</h2>
            <p>Users can create public or private events by providing key details such as location, time, duration, capacity, and price (including free options).

            <h2>Feedback and Reviews</h2>
            <p>After events take place, users can view post-event feedback, which includes comments, ratings, and follow-up interactions. Artists also have the opportunity to earn a rating based on the average score of their hosted events.</p>

            <h2>Discover Events</h2>
            <p>Users can explore and attend events across various categories like Music or Dance, or refine their search by using specific tags such as Ballet or Hip-Hop. By following their favorite artists, they receive notifications about upcoming events, ensuring they stay updated.</p>

            <h2>Create Events</h2>
            <p> Anyone can create an event! Regular users automatically become artists whenever they create their first event.

            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p> Only artists have a profile. There, you can see their rating, as well as their past and future events. </p>
